          <li>Learning new programming languages just so I can say that I know them and never use them</li>

          <li>Playing video games for way too long</li>

          <li>Writing a piece of simple code then spending 17 hours adding more to it until I need to start a new project</li>

          <li>And last but not least, turning something mundane into something fun</li>

      <article>
      <p class="p1">
        After graduating from higschool I felt aimless and went on to become a hairdresser for 3 years, through that job I met one of my now best friends who is a software engineer(one of his many titles) and we hit it off about all things nerdy, he gave me a love for coding and encouraged me to start my own coding projects, a year and a half later, I joined thinkful because despite having probably the skills to make it in the industry I don't do well on interviews and needed help with the getting a job aspect of this industry.<br>

        <br>

        Now here I am writing HTML in an office document so I can prove to myself that I can without the autocomplete, and making this webpage to encourage employers into hiring me, or fellow like minded people to join me on my journey, maybe even to go out to some convention once this pandemic business ends<br>

        <br>

        My interests stretch far and wide, and most likely if it's something unbearably nerdy, from food, to cars, to code, to gaming, to anime and manga, music instruments, and even electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, or history, then chances are I've spent at least a week of my life beyond obsessed with the subject and haven't let go of my fascination with it since.
